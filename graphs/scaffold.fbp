title: Scaffolding

# Generate with fbpx compile
# however it should understand polymer.
# and it always needs a html page as host
# but it would be nice if it could be generated for us.
# maybe fbpx serve graphs/scaffold.fbp ?
# or not sure what vulcanize does.
# would that handle bower dependencies also?
