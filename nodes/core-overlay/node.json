  "description": "The `core-overlay` element displays overlayed on top of other content. It starts\nout hidden and is displayed by setting its `opened` property to true.\nA `core-overlay's` opened state can be toggled by calling the `toggle`\nmethod.\n\nThe `core-overlay` will, by default, show/hide itself when it's opened. The \n`target` property may be set to another element to cause that element to \nbe shown when the overlay is opened.\n\nIt's common to want a `core-overlay` to animate to its opened\nposition. The `core-overlay` element uses a `core-transition` to handle\nanimation. The default transition is `core-transition-fade` which \ncauses the overlay to fade in when displayed. See \n<a href=\"../core-transition/\">`core-transition`</a> for more\ninformation about customizing a `core-overlay's` opening animation. The\n`backdrop` property can be set to true to show a backdrop behind the overlay\nthat will darken the rest of the window.\n\nAn element that should close the `core-overlay` will automatically\ndo so if it's given the `core-overlay-toggle` attribute. This attribute\ncan be customized with the `closeAttribute` property. You can also use\n`closeSelector` if more general matching is needed.\n\nBy default  `core-overlay` will close whenever the user taps outside it or\npresses the escape key. This behavior can be turned off via the\n`autoCloseDisabled` property.\n\n    <core-overlay>\n      <h2>Dialog</h2>\n      <input placeholder=\"say something...\" autofocus>\n      <div>I agree with this wholeheartedly.</div>\n      <button core-overlay-toggle>OK</button>\n    </core-overlay>\n\n`core-overlay` will automatically size and position itself according to the \nfollowing rules. The overlay's size is constrained such that it does not\noverflow the screen. This is done by setting maxHeight/maxWidth on the \n`sizingTarget`. If the `sizingTarget` already has a setting for one of these\nproperties, it will not be overridden. The overlay should\nbe positioned via css or imperatively using the `core-overlay-position` event.\nIf the overlay is not positioned vertically via setting `top` or `bottom`, it\nwill be centered vertically. The same is true horizontally via a setting to \n`left` or `right`. In addition, css `margin` can be used to provide some space\naround the overlay. This can be used to ensure\nthat, for example, a drop shadow is always visible around the overlay.",
