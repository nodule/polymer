  "description": "\n`core-scroll-header-panel` contains a header section and a content section.  The\nheader is initially on the top part of the view but it scrolls away with the \nrest of the scrollable content.  Upon scrolling slightly up at any point, the \nheader scrolls back into view.  This saves screen space and allows users to\naccess important controls by easily moving them back to the view.\n\n__Important:__ The `core-scroll-header-panel` will not display if its parent does not have a height.\n\nUsing [layout attributes](http://www.polymer-project.org/docs/polymer/layout-attrs.html), you can easily make the `core-scroll-header-panel` fill the screen\n\n    <body fullbleed layout vertical>\n      <core-scroll-header-panel flex>\n        <core-toolbar>\n          <div>Hello World!</div>\n        </core-toolbar>\n      </core-scroll-header-panel>\n    </body>\n\nor, if you would prefer to do it in CSS, just give `html`, `body`, and `core-scroll-header-panel` a height of 100%:\n\n    html, body {\n      height: 100%;\n      margin: 0;\n    }\n    core-scroll-header-panel {\n      height: 100%;\n    }\n\n`core-scroll-header-panel` works well with `core-toolbar` but can use any element \nthat represents a header by adding a `core-header` class to it.\n\n    <core-scroll-header-panel>\n      <core-toolbar>Header</core-toolbar>\n      <div>Content goes here...</div>\n    </core-scroll-header-panel>\n\n",
